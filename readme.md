![Screenshot 2023-11-30 043354](https://github.com/Alkaliii/Matrix/assets/53021785/d3069bee-addc-41cf-b50f-1ddad9e7ce47)
A small tool that converts images into text for screens in starship evo. I'll edit this a bit more later.

## How to use Matix
- Upload a file or select an example. PNGs are good üëç
- Use the options to tweak how the screen code is generated. Optimize and Better Colors really should be on by default.
- After you set some options click 'Regenerate'.
- Click on the buttons beside the pixel preview to copy a screen section into your clipboard.
- Once you're finished press the X in the corner to terminate matrix.
