<i>A small tool that converts images into text for screens in <b>Starship Evo</b>.</i>

Matrix Downscales, Cuts, and converts each pixel of a file into a color code preceding an "." to create a "dot matrix" of text that can be pasted into a transparent screen in the game <b>Starship Evo</b>. These screens can be restitched back together to produce the inital image in a retro style without all the hassle of literal pixel art in a bad interface.

## How to Matrix
- Upload a file or select an example. PNGs are good üëç
- Use the options to tweak how the screen code is generated. Optimize and Better Colors really should be on by default.
- After you set some options click 'Regenerate'.
- Click on the buttons beside the pixel preview to copy a screen section into your clipboard.
- Once you're finished press the X in the corner to terminate matrix.
